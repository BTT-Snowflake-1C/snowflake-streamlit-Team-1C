## 🎯 Project Highlights

- Built an interactive **Streamlit-on-Snowflake dashboard** analyzing healthcare access across Arizona counties  
- Combined **SVI, heat risk, and hospital capacity** into a single analytical view  
- Identified counties at highest risk of being **medical deserts**  
- Delivered **interpretable visual analysis** for policy and public health use  
- Integrated a **Snowflake Cortex AI assistant** for natural-language insights

🧠 Project Overview

Connection to Break Through Tech AI

This project was developed as part of the Break Through Tech AI Studio, where fellows work on real-world, industry-aligned data science challenges using enterprise platforms.

Host Context & Objective

The objective of this project is to identify and explain healthcare access gaps (“medical deserts”) in Arizona by analyzing how social vulnerability, heat exposure, population dynamics, and hospital capacity intersect at the county level.

Scope of Work
	•	Data exploration and feature engineering using Snowflake
	•	County-level comparative analysis and visualization
	•	Interpretability-focused modeling evaluation
	•	AI-assisted insight generation for non-technical stakeholders

Real-World Significance

Extreme heat and social vulnerability amplify healthcare inequities. This dashboard helps:
	•	Public health officials prioritize intervention areas
	•	Policymakers allocate healthcare resources more effectively
	•	Communities prepare for climate-driven health risks

⸻

📊 Application Pages
	•	Home — Overview and live data preview
	•	Data Understanding — Raw vs engineered datasets
	•	County Analysis — Population and vulnerability comparisons
	•	Exploratory Visual Analysis — Hospitals, heat, and social barriers
	•	Modeling & Evaluation — Performance interpretation
	•	AI Assistant — Snowflake Cortex–powered Q&A

⸻

🔐 Security & Authentication
	•	Uses Snowflake-native get_active_session()
	•	No hardcoded credentials
	•	AI powered by Snowflake Cortex, not external APIs

⸻

📈 Future Enhancements
	•	Cross-validation with expanded datasets
	•	Geospatial mapping layers
	•	Time-series heat analysis
	•	External validation beyond Arizona
